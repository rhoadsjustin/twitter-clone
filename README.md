## Creating my first React Native App utilizing Cosmic JS for an API endpoint.

----------------------------------------------------------
this app utilizes the <a href="https://expo.io/">Expo toolchain</a>

run ``` npm install ``` to get the dependecies

if you have Xcode installed, you can run ``` npm run ios ``` to run it locally in the simulator. 

if you have the Expo app on your device, running ``` npm run ios ``` will also give a QR code you can scan with your Expo app to have it running on your device.
